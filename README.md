For this project, the main task was to complete the Q-Training Algorithm code block. The objective of implementing deep Q-learning was to 
identify the optimal navigation path that leads to the treasure cell while maximizing the cumulative reward. We were provided with the 
majority of the code for the treasure maze project, including the maze setup and reward structure, the core responsibility of developing and fine-tuning the training algorithm was left to us. 
This entailed designing a robust Q-learning process that could effectively learn from the environment, adapt to various states, and make decisions 
that consistently improved the agent's performance in reaching the treasure efficiently.
